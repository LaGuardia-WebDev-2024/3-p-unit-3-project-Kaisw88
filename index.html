  <h3>How To Go About This Listening Experience</h3>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> From my expereince, this song has been most thoroughly enjoyed when <br> walking somewhere in a hurry. If you don't have anywhere to be, perhaps take a <br> step outside and let the music dictate where you go. <br>
    <strong> Step 2:</strong> I would use your most quality pair of headphones to get the best <br> experience. <br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Often times, especially when listening to Art Blakey, I will do some air <br> drumming and act as if I am playing swing on the ride cymbal like Blakey.<br>
